## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- `Atex.OAuth` refactor:
  - `Atex.OAuth.get_key/0` removed - use `Atex.Config.OAuth.get_key/0` directly
  - `Atex.OAuth.create_client_metadata/1`, `create_client_assertion/3`,
    `create_authorization_url/5`, `validate_authorization_code/5`,
    `refresh_token/5`, `revoke_tokens/2` moved to `Atex.OAuth.Flow`
  - `Atex.OAuth.create_dpop_token/4`, `send_oauth_dpop_request/3`,
    `request_protected_dpop_resource/5` moved to `Atex.OAuth.DPoP`
  - `Atex.OAuth.get_authorization_server/2`,
    `get_authorization_server_metadata/2` moved to `Atex.OAuth.Discovery`
  - Error atom `:invaild_issuer` corrected to `:invalid_issuer` in
    `Atex.OAuth.Discovery`
- `Atex.Config.OAuth.is_localhost/0` renamed to `Atex.Config.OAuth.localhost?/0`
- `Atex.ServiceAuth.validate_jwt/2` now returns `{:error, :invalid_jwt}` on
  malformed input instead of raising

### Added

- `Atex.OAuth.session_keys_name/0` and
  `Atex.OAuth.session_active_session_name/0` expose Plug session key atoms
- `Atex.IdentityResolver` now has full module and function documentation
- `Atex.XRPC.LoginClient` now has a `@moduledoc`
- Optional `:telemetry` instrumentation via `Atex.Telemetry`. Add `{:telemetry, "~> 1.0"}` to
  your deps to receive events from XRPC requests, identity resolution, OAuth flows, and service
  auth validation. See `Atex.Telemetry` for the full event catalogue.
- New `:user_agent` config key under `config :atex`. When set, all outgoing XRPC
  requests include a `User-Agent` header of `"<user_agent> (atex/<version>)"`.
  Defaults to `"atex/<version>"`. See `Atex.Config.user_agent/0`.

### Fixed

- Fix `raw_input` not actually being set as the request's body in
  `Atex.XRPC.post/3` when providing a struct as input.
- `Atex.XRPC.LoginClient.handle_failure/3` now returns consistent 3-tuples
  `{:error, response, client}`
- `Atex.OAuth.Cache` metadata cache `ttl_check_interval` corrected to 5 minutes
  (was 30 seconds)
- Typo in `Atex.OAuth.Error` moduledoc corrected ("extesion" -> "exception")

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Fix a problem with error struct generation with some lexicons in `deflexicon`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-16

### Breaking Changes

- `Atex.NSID` is now a struct (`%Atex.NSID{authority, name, fragment}`). Public
  functions now accept and return structs. You can use `new/1`, `new!/1` or the
  new `~NSID""` for constructing from a NSID string.

### Added

- `Atex.Repo` module for building, mutating, signing, serialising, and loading
  AT Protocol repositories. Also supports lazily streaming from a CAR binary for
  efficient processing of large repository exports.
- `Atex.XRPC.UnauthedClient` module for running unauthenticated XRPC fetches on
  public APIs or PDSes.
- `Atex.Lexicon.Resolver` module for resolving published lexicons by NSID,
  following the
  [publication and resolution spec](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon#lexicon-publication-and-resolution).
- `mix atex.lexicons.resolve` task for resolving one or more lexicons by NSID
  and writing to a JSON file.
- Sigils for `Atex.AtURI` and `Atex.TID`, `~AT"at://..."` and `~TID"..."`
  respectively.
- `/logout` route for `Atex.OAuth.Plug` to revoke the current session, as well
  as `Atex.OAuth.Plug.revoke_session/2` to revoke a conn's session
  programmaticly (e.g. from a session management dashboard).
- `deflexicon` now generates structs for errors defined by queries and
  procedures, under a `Errors` submodule.
- `deflexicon` generated models now have a `coerce_error/1` function that takes
  in a map and tries to convert it to one of its known error structs.
- `Atex.XRPC.Error` struct for wrapping XRPC error responses, including both
  known errors (with typed `error_struct`) and unknown errors.

### Fixed

- Fix issue when trying to validate OAuth authorisation codes in localhost mode
  on PDS implementations that are more strict than the Bluesky reference
  implementation.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-29

### Breaking Changes

- The `Atex.IdentityResolver` config key has been replaced with a flat config
  option. Update your config from:

  ```elixir
    config :atex, Atex.IdentityResolver,
      directory_url: "https://plc.directory"
  ```

  to:

  ```elixir
    config :atex,
      plc_directory_url: "https://plc.directory"
  ```

- `Atex.Config.IdentityResolver` has been renamed to `Atex.Config`.
- `Atex.IdentityResolver.DIDDocument` has been renamed to `Atex.DID.Document`.
- Replace existing `Atex.DID.Document.new/1` method with the method previously
  named `from_json/1`.

### Added

- `Atex.Crypto` module for performing AT Protocol-related cryptographic
  operations.
- `Atex.PLC` module for interacting with
  [a did:plc directory API](https://web.plc.directory/).
- `Atex.ServiceAuth` module for validating
  [inter-service authentication tokens](https://atproto.com/specs/xrpc#inter-service-authentication-jwt).
- Various improvements to `Atex.Did.Document`
  - Add `Atex.DID.Document.Service` and `Atex.DID.Document.VerificationMethod`
    sub-structs.
  - Add `to_json/1` methods and `JSON.Encoder` protocols for easy conversion to
    camelCase JSON.
- `Atex.XRPC.Router` module with `query/3` and `procedure/3` macros for easily
  building XRPC server routes inside a `Plug.Router`, with built-in service auth
  validation and validation if passed the name of a module using `deflexicon`.
- `deflexicon` now emits `content_type/0` functions (on `Input` submodules for
  typed JSON bodies, otherwise on the root module) for procedures.
- `Atex.XRPC.ServiceAuthClient` module for making requests to other atproto
  services using a service auth token.

### Fixed

- Fix a problem where generated `%<LexiconId>.Params` structs could not be
  passed to an XRPC call due to not having the Enumerable protocol implemented.
- Correctly generate `Input`/`Output` submodules with `from_json` methods for
  queries and procedures that use `ref` or `union` types.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-06

### Breaking Changes

- Included `Com.Atproto.*` lexicon modules have been removed and put into
  `atex_atproto` instead.

### Added

- The PLC directory used for identity resolution can now be configured. See
  `Atex.Config.IdentityResolve` for more information. (Thanks
  [@hexmani.ac](https://tangled.org/did:plc:5szlrh3xkfxxsuu4mo6oe6h7)!)
- Add an extra optional `opts` parameter to some `Atex.OAuth` functions, to
  allow for better integration with other ecosystems. (Thanks
  [@lekkice.moe](https://tangled.org/did:plc:dgzvruva4jbzqbta335jtvoz)!)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-07

### Breaking Changes

- `Atex.OAuth.Plug` now raises `Atex.OAuth.Error` exceptions instead of handling
  error situations internally. Applications should implement `Plug.ErrorHandler`
  to catch and gracefully handle them.
- `Atex.OAuth.Plug` now saves only the user's DID in the session instead of the
  entire OAuth session object. Applications must use `Atex.OAuth.SessionStore`
  to manage OAuth sessions.
- `Atex.XRPC.OAuthClient` has been overhauled to use `Atex.OAuth.SessionStore`
  for retrieving and managing OAuth sessions, making it easier to use with not
  needing to manually keep a Plug session in sync.

### Added

- `Atex.OAuth.SessionStore` behaviour and `Atex.OAuth.Session` struct for
  managing OAuth sessions with pluggable storage backends.
  - `Atex.OAuth.SessionStore.ETS` - in-memory session store implementation.
  - `Atex.OAuth.SessionStore.DETS` - persistent disk-based session store
    implementation.
- `Atex.OAuth.Plug` now requires a `:callback` option that is a MFA tuple
  (Module, Function, Args), denoting a callback function to be invoked by after
  a successful OAuth login. See [the OAuth example](./examples/oauth.ex) for a
  simple usage of this.
- `Atex.OAuth.Permission` module for creating
  [AT Protocol permission](https://atproto.com/specs/permission) strings for
  OAuth.
- `Atex.OAuth.Error` exception module for OAuth flow errors. Contains both a
  human-readable `message` string and a machine-readable `reason` atom for error
  handling.
- `Atex.OAuth.Cache` module provides TTL caching for OAuth authorization server
  metadata with a 1-hour default TTL to reduce load on third-party PDSs.
- `Atex.OAuth.get_authorization_server/2` and
  `Atex.OAuth.get_authorization_server_metadata/2` now support an optional
  `fresh` parameter to bypass the cache when needed.

### Changed

- `mix atex.lexicons` now adds `@moduledoc false` to generated modules to stop
  them from automatically cluttering documentation.
- `Atex.IdentityResolver.Cache.ETS` now uses ConCache instead of ETS directly,
  with a 1-hour TTL for cached identity information.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-11-25

### Breaking Changes

- `deflexicon` now converts all def names to be in snake_case instead of the
  casing as written the lexicon.

### Added

- `deflexicon` now emits structs for records, objects, queries, and procedures.
- `Atex.XRPC.get/3` and `Atex.XRPC.post/3` now support having a lexicon struct
  as the second argument instead of the method's name, making it easier to have
  properly checked XRPC calls.
- Add pre-transpiled modules for the core `com.atproto` lexicons.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-11

### Breaking Changes

- Remove `Atex.HTTP` and associated modules as the abstraction caused a bit too
  much complexities for how early atex is. It may come back in the future as
  something more fleshed out once we're more stable.
- Rename `Atex.XRPC.Client` to `Atex.XRPC.LoginClient`

### Added

- `Atex.OAuth` module with utilites for handling some OAuth functionality.
- `Atex.OAuth.Plug` module (if Plug is loaded) which provides a basic but
  complete OAuth flow, including storing the tokens in `Plug.Session`.
- `Atex.XRPC.Client` behaviour for implementing custom client variants.
- `Atex.XRPC` now supports using different client implementations.
- `Atex.XRPC.OAuthClient` to make XRPC calls on the behalf of a user who has
  authenticated with ATProto OAuth.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- `Atex.Lexicon` module that provides the `deflexicon` macro, taking in a JSON
  Lexicon definition and converts it into a series of schemas for each
  definition within it.
- `mix atex.lexicons` for converting lexicon JSON files into modules using
  `deflexicon` easily.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-29

### Changed

- `Atex.XRPC.Adapter` renamed to `Atex.HTTP.Adapter`.

### Added

- `Atex.HTTP` module that delegates to the currently configured adapter.
- `Atex.HTTP.Response` struct to be returned by `Atex.HTTP.Adapter`.
- `Atex.IdentityResolver` module for resolving and validating an identity,
  either by DID or a handle.
  - Also has a pluggable cache (with a default ETS implementation) for keeping
    some data locally.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-09

### Added

- `Atex.TID` module for manipulating ATProto TIDs.
- `Atex.Base32Sortable` module for encoding/decoding numbers as
  `base32-sortable` strings.
- Basic XRPC client.
